## Copyright and Monetization

This application is solely for my educational purposes only. No monetization on this app.

Every piece of code, from frontend to backend was written by me, or copied from a public online source. Anything on the app that has "Â© 2023 Reddit Inc" or similar is for cloning purpose and not affilated with or developed by Reddit.

The Reddit logo is used in this application for cloning purposes only, and not used in any other way or for any other purposes.

The application's frontend is an attempt to make a replica of Reddit's frontend and for my educational purposes only.

This application is deployed to heroku in order to have a live demo of my technical skills for others(recruiters, collegues, etc)

This application was built through reverse engineering, only using information that were publicly available. No source code of Reddit was found or used during development.
